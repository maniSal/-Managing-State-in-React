Checkpoint Managing State in React
Create a simple To-Do List application using React that demonstrates various aspects of state management . The application should allow users to add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as completed. Additionally, implement form validation for adding/editing tasks and utilize browser storage to persist the tasks between sessions.
mplement a form for adding new tasks. The form should include input fields for task name and description, and it should perform validation to ensure that both fields are filled before adding a task.
Display the list of tasks with options to edit, delete, and mark tasks as completed. Completed tasks should be visually distinguished from active tasks.
Allow users to edit task details by clicking on the task. Implement a form pre-filled with task details that enables users to update task name and description.
Provide functionality to delete tasks from the list. Include a confirmation prompt before deleting a task.
Implement browser storage (localStorage or sessionStorage) to persist the tasks between sessions. Ensure that tasks are loaded from storage when the application initializes and saved to storage whenever there is a change in the task list.
Style the application using CSS to make it visually appealing and user-friendly. Use appropriate styling to highlight active and completed tasks.
